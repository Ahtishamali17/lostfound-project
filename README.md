# AI Powered Lost & Found System

An AI-powered web application that helps match lost and found items on a campus using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and image similarity.

The system allows users to report lost items and found items. The application automatically compares descriptions and images to detect possible matches.

- Cosine Similarity

Used to compare descriptions of lost and found items.

### Image Similarity
- Image hashing / OpenCV
- Detects visual similarity between item images.
